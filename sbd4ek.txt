In terms of classes related to embedded systems, I've taken Digital Logic Design, CSO 2, Intro to Embedded Computer Systems, and Computer Architecture and Design. I've worked with STM32, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi microcontrollers. I've mainly used C/C++ for my projects (with a little bit of Python). In terms of projects, I've used a microcontroller in a prototype Bluetooth-operated deadbolt system. It used data from a real-time clock and Bluetooth module to lock and unlock a deadbolt based on information sent over a basic iOS app I made. I also used an Arduino board to read codes from an IR receiver and execute different macros on my laptop based on input from a remote control. I also completed the Intro Embedded projects (quadrature encoding, memory expansion access).

My primary interest when it comes to microcontrollers is to develop embedded systems that automate basic tasks and make my life a little easier. I enjoy learning how to interface with different peripheral devices (clocks, screens, motors) and exploring their capabilities and potential uses in my daily life. Despite this, my knowledge of embedded systems is very limited, especially when it comes to knowing the advantages of different platforms and how to program embedded systems beyond very basic functionalities. Through this class, I want to improve my programming and design skills when it comes to embedded systems and microcontrollers. I also want to gain a deeper understanding of how these devices work, the full range of their capabilities, and how to take advantage of those abilities and apply them to my own needs.
