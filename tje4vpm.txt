I developed some RTL for a microcontroller being published in CICC. I also took a few classes on microelectronics previously. I know basic C, verilog, and a bit of assembly. I worked with the Cortex M0+, arduinos of all types, ESP32s, FPGAs like the Pynq and Artix boards, and some ASICs. I've also become familiar with machine learning and frameworks like tensorflow/pytorch through jobs and AI Hardware.
I am interested in distributed systems, ultra low power microcontrollers, overcoming the memory wall, and optimizing energy efficiency and area VS other metrics like latency, throughput, etc. Id like to develop communication protocols and operating systems that require the absolute minimum memory and energy to function as desired. Im interested in density of devices and circuit design especially. I expect to learn how to develop an RTOS in this class and how to optimize different blocks for user specifications. I expect to learn about the tradeoffs in computer architecture and firmware design as well.
