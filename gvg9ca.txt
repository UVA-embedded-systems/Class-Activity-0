EXPECTATION:
   I hope to learn more about embedded systems because I wish to pursue a career in embedded systems.
   I wish to learn and grow more my knowledge of computer hardware. I'm also really interested to
   program the BoosterPack to play games because from Intro to Embedded I knew there had to be a way
   but didn't have the time to do so.
