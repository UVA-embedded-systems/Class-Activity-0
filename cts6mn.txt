Relevant Courses taken:
- Intro to Embedded Systems

Experience:
I have worked with the STM32 in my intro embedded class. I have worked with the MSPM0 for my Capstone Project which included improvising Prof. Valvano's robot. I also worked with embedded systems as a whole in my internship which included working with satellites.

Expectation from the class:
I would like to learn using RTOS environments as it is very relevant to industry. I also want to build a solid foundation to understand how DSP operates at a hardware level.
