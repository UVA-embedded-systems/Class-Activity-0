I've taken Intro to Embedded Systems, and I've done some stuff in Delong's FPGA lab last semester. I've done a fair among of programming for various classwork and for video game side projects.
I've enjoyed learning how computers work and taking various circuits classes the past few years, and I hope I'll get to see both of those subjects in this class. I also enjoy making video games, so I'm quite excited to see what the final project will be like.
