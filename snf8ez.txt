courses: intro to embedded, CS computer architecture, ECE computer architecture
projects: responsive LED Grid, ML gesture recognition 
platforms: STM32, OpenMV H7 + Edge Impulse
languages: Python, Java, C

I am interested in this class because I expect it to
strip away many of the layers of abstraction commonly
found in projects. By focusing on a single, simple, 
computer, this course will encourage a full understanding 
of the computer including management of the memory, 
I/O, and OS. Last semester, I took CS computer
architecture which focused on low-level CPU operation down
to the cycle count. I hope to gain more experience with
programming in this way: writing code that is optimized
for specific hardware.
