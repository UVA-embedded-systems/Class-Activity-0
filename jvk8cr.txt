I've taken intro to embedded and CSO 2, my capstone project was creating a device to get badminton player metrics using various sensors. I've used nRF52840s, Arduinos, and Raspberry Picos using C and micropython.

My interests are in networks and security, and I hope to learn how operating systems work along with how embedded systems are designed.
