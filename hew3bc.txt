This course builds on the material taught in the intro class while introducing new applications 
for real-time systems. I’m interested in learning about RTOS beacuse of its relevance to modern embedded 
applications and how it enables systems act predictibly to meet strict time constraints. In this class I am 
excited about learning and building projecst that can respond and behave in the real world.
