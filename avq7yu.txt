My background in embedded systems includes intro to embedded systems, Computer architecture, CSO1, and Iam currently taking CSO2.
I also have a fair amount of programming experience, in python, java, C, from my undergraduate career thus far. 
As part of the final project for my intro to embedded course, I interfaced an EEPROM board with an STM32 microcontroller by writing SPI and I2C functions. 
This was done to sample and store an inputted analog signal. As far as microcontrollers, I'm familliar with bot the STM32 and the TI ARM cortex-M0+ microcontroller.

I'm taking this course because of my interest in more complex embedded systems that require RTOS. 
I hope to gain more experience with design patters specific to embedded software development.
I also have a broad interest in networks and IoT, so I'm hoping to see how I could further bridge these topics.
