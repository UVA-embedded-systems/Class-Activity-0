I used the STM32 microcontroller in intro to embedded and I worked
with the ESP32 microcontroller using C++ for my capstone project last semester.
I have also taken CSO1/CSO2. My interests are competitve shooting and playing video games. Im hoping to
learn more about RTOS and hopefully become prepared for a job in embedded design.
