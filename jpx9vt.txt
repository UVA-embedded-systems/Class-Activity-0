My name is Zourong Jiang and all my friends call me JOJO. My UVA ID is jpx9vt.

I learned a little bit STM32-related content during my undergraduate studies. I used to try to complete STM32-based line-following robot project. I hope this class will help me gain a deeper understanding of embedded systems.
