Experience with Embedded
Intro to Embedded Systems

Computer Science:
Data Structures 1
Computer Systems & Organization 1 & 2
Software Development Essentials
Cybersecurity

Projects:
None outside of coursework

I have experience with both the TI MSPM0+ and STM32 Microcontrollers
Only experience using x86 assembly and C with embedded work


My goal for this class is to further develop my understanding and skill 
set in working with embedded real-time systems. I see this as a valuable 
skill, especially as I prepare for my capstone project in Fall 2026. 
I am also interested in exploring embedded systems as a potential career 
path, and this course will help strengthen the fundamentals expected when 
working with these systems. Additionally, I want to improve my ability to 
read and interpret datasheets and other technical documentation, which I 
see as an important practical skill.
