I have taken the ECE introductory embedded course, CS CSO1 and CSO2 courses, ECE computer architecture, and CS hardware security courses. I have also taken and TA for the ASIC/FPGA design lab. I used the STM32 microcontroller and associated environment in intro to embedded. I used the ESP32S3 with platform.io in my capstone project involving finger/wrist tracking, wireless communication, robotic arm actuation, and haptic feedback. I use the Propeller with SimpleIDE in my work with a chemistry research lab to revamp their embedded system for valving of microfluidics disks. I am familiar with C, Python, and Java.
I am primarily interested in digital hardware design, computer architecture, and embedded systems. I hope to gain a better understanding of how to manage embedded computing resources as well as the inner workings of the RTOS frameworks. I also hope to gain a better understanding of the ARM architectures.
